Two folders: scalar-on-function and function-on-function are used to store files related to different tasks. Each of the folders contains the following files:

- `Real` - real datasets and corresponding scripts used for fine-tuning and producing the results.
- `Simulation` - folder `data` that was used to generate the data and the corresponding scripts used to conduct the simulation experiments.
- `Models.py` - all the PyTorch neural network model classes
- `Utils.py` - standard FDA models, PyTorch helper functions, cross-validation, etc.
